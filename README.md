# medical-student-dataset-
showing the use of pivot chart and data visualization
It started with a set of missing and unclean data which contains student ID,Age, BMI,Temperature ,Heart rate,blood pressure and cholesterol columns with the corresponding data set accross the rows.
I started by cleaning the data,removing duplicates and filling the blank spaces with some formed dataset.
After that i used pivot chart table to analyze some questions concerning the data
After which,it lead to data visualiation with corresponding column chart,pie chart,doughnut chart,area chart , line chart 

Some set of questions like,the average value of males and females across the Age, BMI,Temperature ,Heart rate,blood pressure and cholesterol
